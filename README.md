These are scripts I use often when working in the terminal often for 
data frames (tab/comma delimited text files).
Use it as you would awk sed and grep and other command line tools
with pipe

Note that majority of these scripts will work only with python3 and 
require pandas library

INSTALL
* create a bin file (```mkdir ~/bin```) and add these scripts in that folder
* add this folder to the path in your .bashrc (i.e. ```export PATH=$PATH:~/bin```)
